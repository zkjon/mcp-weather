   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a branch for your feature**

   # or for bugs:
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

3. **Make your changes**

   - Follow the project's code standards
   - Add tests if necessary

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: clear description of your change"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**

### Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to maintain a clean history:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Formatting changes (do not affect functionality)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Add or modify tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for multiple languages"
git commit -m "fix: correct geocoding error"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new instructions"
```

## Code Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- **Use TypeScript** for static typing
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Semicolons**: Always
- **Quotes**: Double quotes for strings
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes

### Code Example

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface WeatherData {
    temperature: number;
    humidity: number;
    location: string;
}

async function getWeatherData(location: string): Promise<WeatherData> {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/weather?location=${location}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    return {
        temperature: data.temp,
        humidity: data.humidity,
        location: location
    };
}

// ‚ùå Bad
function getweather(loc) {
    return fetch('https://api.example.com/weather?location=' + loc).then(r => r.json())
}
```

### Comments

- **Document complex functions**
- **Explain the "why", not the "what"**
- **Use JSDoc for public functions**

```typescript
/**
 * Gets weather data for a specific location
 * @param location - Location name (city, country, etc.)
 * @returns Structured weather data
 */
async function getWeatherData(location: string): Promise<WeatherData> {
    // Implementation...
}
```
